MailChimp PHP API Wrapper 2.0.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
API Version: 2.0
Tested under: PHP 5.3

Requires:
    * PHP 5.2+
    * CURL + SSL support for PHP

===== About =====
Our MCAPI (MailChimp API) wrapper class is provided to help jump-start your PHP 
development efforts. Using it allows you to ignore the whole network 
connectivity and data transfer pieces that are typically necessary when using an
API. When using this, you will simply create a PHP object and start calling 
the methods that you need.

The examples contained in this package are simply the examples interspersed 
throughout our API documentation. They are not meant to be full working 
programs that do something useful. Rather they are provided to give you working
examples of most methods we expose to play around with, start getting 
comfortable with, and work into your own programs as necessary.

These examples were also written from and intended to be run from a Shell/
Terminal/Command Line. If you are not familiar with executing PHP code from a
command line, see here:
    http://us3.php.net/features.commandline

===== Getting Started =====
1) Grab your API key from http://admin.mailchimp.com/account/api/
2) The API Key can be provided to the wrapper through one of the following options:
    * passed directly in the constructor like:
        $api = new Mailchimp($apikey);
    * saved in ~/.mailchimp.key
    * saved in /etc/mailchimp.key

2) Try running mcapi_lists.php from the command line. Something like this:
    # php -f mcapi_lists.php 

NOTE: the one major difference between using this wrapper and the API 
documentation is that your will *never* have to provide the "api_key" parameter
when using the wrapper class. It's done for you in the background.

Finally, please do not forget to do error checking. This wrapper will throw PHP 
Exceptions to make errors a bit harder to ignore, but you should do something
with them like at least logging them.

===== Advanced Options =====
Custom Timeouts
------------------
This wrapper defaults the Timeout value for a call to 600 seconds. To adjust that for
various calls, simply specify it in the constructor:
	$api = new Mailchimp($apikey, array('timeout'=>300));

That cannot currently be changed between calls without reinstantiating the 
Mailchimp object. 

Debug mode
------------------
This will turn on verbose Curl logging along with some of our own. Enable it in the
constructor like so:
	$api = new Mailchimp($apikey, array('debug'=>true));
